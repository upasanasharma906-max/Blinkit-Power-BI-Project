#Goal of the Dashboard
-The goal of this Power BI dashboard is to create a centralized reporting system that allows decision-makers to:
-Monitor sales performance in real time
-Compare revenue contributions across outlets and product categories
-Analyze customer behavior through ratings and purchasing patterns
-Identify opportunities for growth and cost optimization

#Business Insights
-Top-Performing Categories
Certain categories consistently contribute more to overall sales.
Example: Snacks and Beverages generated ₹3.5M in sales, accounting for 35% of total revenue, while categories like Household Items contributed less than 10%, suggesting the need for more targeted promotions in underperforming categories.

-Outlet Contribution
 Different outlet sizes and formats impact revenue differently.
 Example: Tier-1 city outlets delivered ₹2M higher sales compared to smaller outlets in Tier-2 cities, indicating the   importance of expanding premium outlet formats in metropolitan areas.

-Customer Preference
 Customer ratings directly influence sales volume.
 Example: Products rated 4★ and above showed 25% higher sales compared to products rated below 3★. For instance, Dairy Products with a 4.5★ rating outsold lower-rated alternatives by a significant margin.

-Trend Analysis
Sales show seasonality and peak trends.
Example: Sales spiked by 40% in December due to holiday demand, while summer months saw higher beverage sales compared to winter, highlighting the need for seasonal inventory planning.

-Growth Opportunities
Underperforming outlets and categories can be improved.
Example: Frozen Food category contributed only ₹0.5M in sales compared to top categories exceeding ₹3M. Introducing bundled offers or promotional campaigns could help boost sales in such categories.
